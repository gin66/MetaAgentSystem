# Agile Implementation Plan for Meta Agentic AI System (Fast Sprints)

## Objective
Develop a Meta Agentic AI System in a dedicated `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder, using Swift and Ollama with structured output mode. The system will feature agents running in isolated Swift containers, and will be developed through logical, testable steps executed as fast as possible.

## Agile Principles
- Rapid, incremental development with testable deliverables.
- Frequent validation through unit and integration tests.
- Incorporate stakeholder feedback after each sprint.
- Prioritize modularity, scalability, and preventing infinite loops.

## Sprint Plan (Logical, Testable Steps)

### Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Hello World
- **Goal**: Establish the Swift project structure within the `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder and verify basic Ollama API integration.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder.
  - Initialize a Swift project within the `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder using `swift package init`.
  - Add dependencies: `OpenAPIKit`, `SwiftNIO`, `UUID`.
  - Create a program that sends a prompt to the Ollama API and prints the JSON response.
  - Parse the structured JSON output using Ollama's structured output mode.
- **Deliverable**: A Swift program within the `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder that makes an Ollama API call and outputs JSON.
- **Test**: Verify the API call succeeds and the JSON is valid.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: The program compiles, executes the API call, and outputs valid JSON.

### Sprint 2: Core Data Structures
- **Goal**: Define and manage agent and task structures.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define `Agent` struct (ID, role, performance score).
  - Define `Task` struct (ID, description, assigned agent, status).
  - Implement in-memory storage for agents and tasks.
  - Add CLI to create/list agents and tasks.
- **Deliverable**: System to create and store agents/tasks.
- **Test**: Unit tests for struct creation and CLI functionality.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: CLI creates/lists agents and tasks correctly.

### Sprint 3: Task Assignment and Agent Containerization
- **Goal**: Enable dynamic task assignment and run agents in containers.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement logic to assign tasks based on agent roles.
  - Use Swift concurrency for thread-safe agent/task management.
  - Set up Swift containerization for individual agent execution.
  - Update CLI to assign tasks and display assignments.
- **Deliverable**: System assigns tasks to containerized agents and tracks status.
- **Test**: Integration tests for task assignment, concurrency, and container isolation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Tasks assigned correctly; agents run in isolated containers; CLI shows assignments.

### Sprint 4: Judge Agents and Evaluation
- **Goal**: Implement judge agents for performance evaluation in containers.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define `PerformanceMetrics` struct (task ID, agent ID, score, feedback).
  - Implement judge agent logic using Ollama API with structured output mode.
  - Run judge agents in isolated Swift containers.
  - Add judge selection based on performance scores.
- **Deliverable**: Judge agents evaluate tasks with structured JSON output in containers.
- **Test**: Unit tests for judge evaluation, JSON output, and container isolation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Judges produce valid JSON with score (0-1) and feedback in containers.

### Sprint 5: Optimization and Loop Prevention
- **Goal**: Optimize assignments and prevent infinite loops.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement task reassignment based on performance metrics.
  - Add cycle detection to prevent excessive reassignments.
  - Track task completion to ensure progress.
- **Deliverable**: System optimizes assignments and avoids "spinning the wheels."
- **Test**: Tests for optimization logic and loop prevention.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Tasks complete without infinite loops; performance improves.

### Sprint 6: Full Integration
- **Goal**: Integrate all components and validate end-to-end functionality.
- **Tasks**:
  - Combine agent management, task assignment, and evaluation with containerized agents.
  - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
  - Test with sample tasks and multiple containerized agents.
- **Deliverable**: Fully integrated system with test coverage and containerized agents.
- **Test**: End-to-end tests for workflow execution with containerized agents.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: System handles sample workflows and passes all tests.

### Sprint 7: Refinement and Deployment
- **Goal**: Refine system and prepare for production.
- **Tasks**:
  - Incorporate stakeholder feedback on functionality.
  - Optimize Ollama API call performance and error handling.
  - Add logging and documentation.
  - Verify containerized agent execution stability.
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready system with documentation and stable containerized agents.
- **Test**: Stress tests and stakeholder validation with containerized agents.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: System meets requirements; documentation clear; containerized agents stable.

## Timeline
- **Duration**: As fast as possible, driven by task completion and testing.
- **Review Points**: After each sprint for stakeholder feedback and validation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Language**: Swift
- **Containerization**: Swift containers for individual agents
- **Dependencies**: `OpenAPIKit`, `SwiftNIO`, `UUID`
- **API**: Ollama with structured output mode
- **Testing**: XCTest for unit and integration tests

## Risk Mitigation
- **Infinite Loops**: Implement cycle detection and completion thresholds.
- **API Reliability**: Add retry logic and error handling for Ollama.
- **Scalability**: Test with increasing agent/task loads; ensure concurrency safety.
- **Container Stability**: Validate containerized agent execution for isolation and performance.
