# Agile Implementation Plan for Meta Agentic AI System (Fast Sprints)

## Objective
Develop a Meta Agentic AI System using Rust and OpenAI API with structured JSON output, using logical, testable steps executed as fast as possible.

## Agile Principles
- Rapid, incremental development with testable deliverables.
- Frequent validation through unit and integration tests.
- Incorporate stakeholder feedback after each sprint.
- Prioritize modularity, scalability, and preventing infinite loops.

## Sprint Plan (Logical, Testable Steps)

### Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Hello World
- **Goal**: Establish Rust environment and basic OpenAI API integration.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize Rust project with `cargo init`.
  - Add dependencies: `openai-api`, `serde`, `tokio`, `uuid`.
  - Create program that sends a prompt to OpenAI API and prints JSON response.
  - Parse structured JSON output.
- **Deliverable**: Rust program making OpenAI API call with JSON output.
- **Test**: Verify API call succeeds and JSON is valid.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Program compiles, executes API call, and outputs valid JSON.

### Sprint 2: Core Data Structures
- **Goal**: Define and manage agent and task structures.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define `Agent` struct (ID, role, performance score).
  - Define `Task` struct (ID, description, assigned agent, status).
  - Implement in-memory storage for agents and tasks.
  - Add CLI to create/list agents and tasks.
- **Deliverable**: System to create and store agents/tasks.
- **Test**: Unit tests for struct creation and CLI functionality.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: CLI creates/lists agents and tasks correctly.

### Sprint 3: Task Assignment
- **Goal**: Enable dynamic task assignment to agents.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement logic to assign tasks based on agent roles.
  - Add mutex for thread-safe agent/task management.
  - Update CLI to assign tasks and display assignments.
- **Deliverable**: System assigns tasks to agents and tracks status.
- **Test**: Integration tests for task assignment and thread safety.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Tasks are assigned correctly; CLI shows assignments.

### Sprint 4: Judge Agents and Evaluation
- **Goal**: Implement judge agents for performance evaluation.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define `PerformanceMetrics` struct (task ID, agent ID, score, feedback).
  - Implement judge agent logic using OpenAI API with JSON output.
  - Add judge selection based on performance scores.
- **Deliverable**: Judge agents evaluate tasks with structured JSON output.
- **Test**: Unit tests for judge evaluation and JSON output validation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Judges produce valid JSON with score (0-1) and feedback.

### Sprint 5: Optimization and Loop Prevention
- **Goal**: Optimize assignments and prevent infinite loops.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement task reassignment based on performance metrics.
  - Add cycle detection to prevent excessive reassignments.
  - Track task completion to ensure progress.
- **Deliverable**: System optimizes assignments and avoids "spinning the wheels."
- **Test**: Tests for optimization logic and loop prevention.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Tasks complete without infinite loops; performance improves.

### Sprint 6: Full Integration
- **Goal**: Integrate all components and validate end-to-end functionality.
- **Tasks**:
  - Combine agent management, task assignment, and evaluation.
  - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
  - Test with sample tasks and multiple agents.
- **Deliverable**: Fully integrated system with test coverage.
- **Test**: End-to-end tests for workflow execution.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: System handles sample workflows and passes all tests.

### Sprint 7: Refinement and Deployment
- **Goal**: Refine system and prepare for production.
- **Tasks**:
  - Incorporate stakeholder feedback on functionality.
  - Optimize API call performance and error handling.
  - Add logging and documentation.
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready system with documentation.
- **Test**: Stress tests and stakeholder validation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: System meets requirements; documentation is clear.

## Timeline
- **Duration**: As fast as possible, driven by task completion and testing.
- **Review Points**: After each sprint for stakeholder feedback and validation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Language**: Rust.
- **Dependencies**: `openai-api`, `serde`, `tokio`, `uuid`.
- **API**: OpenAI API with structured JSON output.
- **Testing**: `cargo test` for unit and integration tests.

## Risk Mitigation
- **Infinite Loops**: Implement cycle detection and completion thresholds.
- **API Reliability**: Add retry logic and error handling.
- **Scalability**: Test with increasing agent/task loads; ensure thread safety.
