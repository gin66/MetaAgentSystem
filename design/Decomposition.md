# Feature Decomposition

Decomposing features along hierarchical design.

The Decomposition agent processes one feature at a time, using the feature description and a set of related files to break it down into smaller, more manageable sub-features.

## Rules
- Max 5 sub-elements per level.
- Sub-features should be atomic (requiring changes to one file) where possible.
