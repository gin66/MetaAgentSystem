# Meta Agentic AI System

## Overview
This project involves developing a Meta Agentic AI system using Swift and Ollama. The system is designed to be self-improving, optimizing agent and LLM performance through adaptive process design and rigorous performance evaluation. The entire system will be developed in a dedicated `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder.

The project is structured into two main parts:
1.  A `bootstrap` utility to set up the development environment and manage dependencies.
2.  The `MetaAgentSystem` itself, which contains the core logic for the agentic AI system.

## Vision
The vision is to create a dynamic, self-improving meta agentic AI system that optimizes agent and LLM performance, ensuring continuous progress and breakthrough results through adaptive process design and rigorous performance evaluation.

## Stakeholder Requirements
The system will manage agent-LLM pairings, optimize processes, and ensure continuous progress via performance evaluation, with agents running in isolated Swift containers.

## Agile Plan
The project will follow an agile implementation plan with fast sprints. Each sprint will deliver a testable deliverable, and the project will be developed in a dedicated `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder.

## Current Sprint
The current sprint focuses on setting up the project structure, including the `bootstrap` utility and the `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder.
