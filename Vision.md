# Vision and Mission Statement for Meta Agentic AI System

## Vision
To create a dynamic, self-improving meta agentic AI system, developed within a dedicated `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder, that optimizes agent and LLM performance, ensuring continuous progress and breakthrough results through adaptive process design and rigorous performance evaluation.

## Mission
To design and manage a meta agentic AI framework that:
- Dynamically assigns and optimizes agent-LLM pairings for tasks, acting as an AI-driven "Human Resources" manager.
- Employs managed judge agents to evaluate performance, ensuring accountability and measurable outcomes.
- Prevents "spinning the wheels" by enforcing iterative progress, avoiding endless loops of rework or over-optimization.
- Delivers efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions by continuously refining processes and agent capabilities.

## Documentation Structure
