# Sprint 1 Implementation Plan

## Task 1: Create Module Structure in `Package.swift`

### Detailed Steps:
1.  Create a `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder to house the main application.
2.  Update the root `Package.swift` to only include the `Bootstrap` target.
3.  Create a new `Package.swift` inside the `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder.
4.  Define the `MetaAgentSystem` executable target and its dependencies in the new `Package.swift`.
5.  Ensure `bootstrap.swift` is correctly referenced in the root package manifest.
6.  Validate that both `Package.swift` files conform to Swift best practices.

### Code Files:
-   `Package.swift`
-   `MetaAgentSystem/Package.swift`

### Tests:
N/A (Package configuration)

### Alignment with Vision and Requirements:
This step establishes a solid foundation for module management as per the overall vision and stakeholder requirements.

## Task 2: Implement Basic Bootstrap Functionality to Validate Setup

### Detailed Steps:
1.  Develop minimal bootstrap code in `Sources/Bootstrap/bootstrap.swift` that runs without errors.
2.  Ensure `bootstrap.swift` can be executed to set up the development environment.
3.  Validate through basic execution to confirm error-free operation.

### Code Files:
-   `Sources/Bootstrap/bootstrap.swift`
-   `Package.swift`

### Tests:
N/A (Bootstrap validation is done by running it)

### Alignment with Vision and Requirements:
Validating initial setup ensures adherence to development best practices, supporting a scalable architecture.

## Task 3: Develop Initial Data Models Representing Agents and Interactions

### Detailed Steps:
1.  Define core data models for agents based on `StakeholderRequirements.md` in the `MetaAgentSystem/Sources/MetaAgentSystem/Models` module.
2.  Establish relationships between different data entities representing interactions or messages.
3.  Ensure all new data models are cleanly defined, modularized, and follow Swift conventions.
4.  Include necessary initializers, properties, and methods for basic functionality.

### Code Files:
-   `MetaAgentSystem/Sources/MetaAgentSystem/Models/Agent.swift`
-   `MetaAgentSystem/Sources/MetaAgentSystem/Models/Interaction.swift`

### Tests:
Develop unit tests in `MetaAgentSystem/Tests/MetaAgentSystemTests/ModelsTests.swift` to ensure data models are created, manipulated, and interact correctly.

### Alignment with Vision and Requirements:
Data model creation aligns closely with stakeholder requirements and foundational vision for agentic interactions.

## Task 4: Write Unit Tests for New Data Models Ensuring Correctness

### Detailed Steps:
1.  Create a test suite within the `MetaAgentSystem/Tests` folder to cover all data models in the `Models` module.
2.  Develop unit tests for each model, ensuring all properties and methods work as expected.
3.  Implement mock interactions to validate relationships between entities.
4.  Aim for 100% coverage with a focus on correctness and performance.

### Code Files:
-   `MetaAgentSystem/Tests/MetaAgentSystemTests/ModelsTests.swift`

### Tests:
Implement detailed unit tests as mentioned above, focusing on data model interactions and integrity.

### Alignment with Vision and Requirements:
Comprehensive testing ensures that the foundational components meet all defined requirements and work seamlessly together.
