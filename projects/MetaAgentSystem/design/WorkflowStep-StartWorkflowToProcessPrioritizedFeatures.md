# Design Document for Feature F-1.3
## Goal: Implement feature to start workflow to process prioritized features

## Step: Start workflow to process prioritized features

### Components
#### Classes
* **FeatureProcessor**: Manages the processing of prioritized features.
  * `start()` - Begins the workflow.
  * `processNextFeature()` - Processes the next feature based on priority.
  * `getPrioritizedFeatures()` - Retrieves a list of features sorted by priority.

* **FeatureRepository**: Interface for accessing and managing feature data.
  * `getAllFeatures()` - Fetches all features from the database.

#### Structs
None

#### Functions
None

#### Protocols
* **FeatureRepositoryProtocol**: Defines methods for fetching and managing features.

### Interactions
1. The `FeatureProcessor` class is instantiated and its `start()` method is called to begin processing prioritized features.
2. Within the `start()` method, `getPrioritizedFeatures()` retrieves a list of features sorted by priority from the `FeatureRepository`.
3. The `processNextFeature()` method processes each feature in order until all are completed or an interruption occurs.

### Detailed Design
```swift
protocol FeatureRepositoryProtocol {
    func getAllFeatures() -> [Feature]
}

class FeatureRepository: FeatureRepositoryProtocol {
    // Implementation for fetching features from a database
}

struct Feature {
    let id: String
    let priority: Int
    let description: String
    let status: String
}

class FeatureProcessor {
    private var featureRepository: FeatureRepositoryProtocol
    init(featureRepository: FeatureRepositoryProtocol) {
        self.featureRepository = featureRepository
    }
    func start() {
        let features = getPrioritizedFeatures()
        for feature in features {
            processNextFeature(feature)
        }
    }
    private func getPrioritizedFeatures() -> [Feature] {
        let allFeatures = featureRepository.getAllFeatures()
        return allFeatures.sorted(by: { $0.priority < $1.priority })
    }
    private func processNextFeature(_ feature: Feature) {
        // Logic to process a single feature
        print("Processing feature: \(feature.description)")
        // Update the status of the feature as needed
    }
}
```

### Test Plan
#### Strategy
Comprehensive testing using unit and integration tests.

#### Execution Steps
1. Implement unit tests for `FeatureProcessor` methods (`start`, `processNextFeature`, `getPrioritizedFeatures`).
2. Implement integration test to verify the entire workflow starting from prioritization to feature processing completion.
3. Ensure that features are processed in the correct order of priority.
4. Verify edge cases such as empty feature list or features with equal priorities.

#### Criteria
* All unit tests pass successfully.
* Integration tests confirm the system starts processing features in order of priority.
