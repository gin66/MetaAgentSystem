# Design Document: Modify Package.swift to Setup Dependencies and Targets

## Goal
Set up project infrastructure and define initial system architecture.

## Sprint Step
Modify `Package.swift` to set up dependencies and targets according to `AgilePlan.md`.

## Components
### Package.swift
- Defines the Swift package, including its name, platforms, products, and dependencies.

### AgilePlan.md
- Contains the project plan with details on dependencies and targets required for this sprint.

## Classes/Structs
None specifically. The design revolves around modifying the `Package.swift` file directly.

## Functions
None explicitly defined in this step.

## Protocols
None relevant to this specific task.

## Interactions
- **Read AgilePlan.md**:
  - Parse `AgilePlan.md` for required dependencies and targets.
- **Modify Package.swift**:
  - Set up the project infrastructure by updating dependencies and targets in `Package.swift`.

## Detailed Steps
1. **Parse AgilePlan.md**:
   - Extract dependency names, versions, and target specifications from `AgilePlan.md`.
2. **Update Dependencies in Package.swift**:
   - Add required dependencies under the `.package()` initializer within `dependencies`.
3. **Define Targets in Package.swift**:
   - Update targets in the `.target()` initializer to include all specified modules and their dependencies.

## Example of Package.swift Modifications
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "ProjectName",
    platforms: [
        .macOS(.v10_15),
        .iOS(.v13)
    ],
    products: [
        .library(name: "LibraryName", targets: ["TargetName"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/dependency/repo.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "TargetName",
            dependencies: ["DependencyName"]),
        .testTarget(
            name: "TargetNameTests",
            dependencies: ["TargetName"])
    ]
)
```
