# Design Document for AgentCommunicator Class Implementation in Networking Directory

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation details of the `AgentCommunicator` class, which will be located in the `Networking` directory. The primary purpose of this class is to facilitate communication between agents using a basic protocol.

## Components
### AgentCommunicator Class
The `AgentCommunicator` class will be responsible for establishing connections and managing message exchange between different agents.

#### Properties
- `url: URL`: The base URL for the agent server or service.
- `session: URLSession`: The session used to make HTTP requests.

#### Methods
- `init(url: URL)`: Initializes a new instance of AgentCommunicator with a specified URL.
- `sendMessage(message: String, completion: @escaping (Result<Data?, Error>) -> Void)`: Sends an HTTP POST request with the given message and calls the provided completion handler upon receiving the response or encountering an error.

## Interactions
The `AgentCommunicator` class will interact with external services via URLSession to send and receive data. Additionally, it will communicate with other parts of the system through its public methods for sending messages.

### Example Usage
```swift
import Foundation

let agentURL = URL(string: "https://example.com/api/agent")!
let communicator = AgentCommunicator(url: agentURL)

communicator.sendMessage(message: "Hello, World!" , completion: { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let data):
        print("Received data: \(String(describing: data))")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failed with error: \(error)")
    }
})
```

## Conclusion
This document provides a clear and concise design for the `AgentCommunicator` class, including its properties, methods, and interactions. Developers should be able to implement this class according to the provided specifications without further clarification.
