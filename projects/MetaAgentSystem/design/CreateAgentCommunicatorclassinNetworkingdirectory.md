# Agent Communicator Class Design

## Overview
The `AgentCommunicator` class is designed to handle basic agent communication protocols. It will reside in the Networking directory and provide a structured way to send, receive, and manage messages between agents.

## Components
### Classes
#### `AgentCommunicator`
- **Purpose**: Central class responsible for handling all agent communications.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Send messages to other agents.
  - Receive messages from other agents.
  - Maintain a list of connected agents.
  - Manage connection status and handle reconnections if needed.

#### `Message`
- **Purpose**: Represent a message to be sent or received by an agent.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Store metadata (sender, receiver, timestamp).
  - Carry the actual content of the communication.

### Structs
None for this implementation step.

### Functions
#### `AgentCommunicator`
- `init()`: Initialize the communicator with default settings.
- `connect(agentId: String)`: Establish a connection to an agent identified by `agentId`.
- `disconnect(agentId: String)`: Terminate a connection to an agent identified by `agentId`.
- `sendMessage(to: String, message: Message)`: Send a message to a specific agent.
- `receiveMessages()`: Retrieve messages received from all connected agents.

### Protocols
None for this implementation step.

## Interactions
1. **Initialization**: An instance of `AgentCommunicator` is created and initialized with default settings.
2. **Connection Management**:
   - Agents can connect by calling `connect(agentId: String)`.
   - Connections are managed internally using a list or dictionary structure to keep track of connected agents.
3. **Message Handling**: 
   - Messages are sent using `sendMessage(to: String, message: Message)` which routes the message appropriately based on the recipient's agent ID.
   - Received messages can be fetched using `receiveMessages()` method.
4. **Disconnection**: Connections to specific agents can be terminated using `disconnect(agentId: String)`.
