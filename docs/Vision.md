# Vision and Mission Statement for Meta Agentic AI System

## Vision
To create a dynamic, self-improving meta agentic AI system, developed within a dedicated `MetaAgentSystem` sub-folder, that optimizes agent and LLM performance through hierarchical decomposition, feature prioritization, parallel implementation, and comprehensive testing, ensuring continuous progress, breakthrough results, and no regressions via adaptive process design and rigorous performance evaluation.

## Mission
To design and manage a meta agentic AI framework that:
- Maintains a database of features and use cases, prioritizes them, and processes them systematically, including mandatory test plans.
- Judges feature clarity, decomposes complex features along a hierarchical system design (max 5 sub-elements per level), and activates refactoring when architecture changes are needed.
- Dynamically assigns and optimizes agent-LLM pairings for tasks, acting as an AI-driven "Human Resources" manager.
- Employs managed judge agents to evaluate performance, ensuring accountability and measurable outcomes.
- Prevents "spinning the wheels" by enforcing iterative progress, avoiding endless loops of rework or over-optimization.
- Supports parallel implementation by independent agents for non-atomic features.
- Ensures every feature includes a test plan, strategy, and execution; features are incomplete without passing tests.
- Prevents regressions by running full regression tests after each implementation.
- Delivers efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions by continuously refining processes and agent capabilities.
