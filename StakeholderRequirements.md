# Stakeholder Requirements Document for Meta Agentic AI System

## 1. Purpose
To define the requirements for a Meta Agentic AI System that manages agent-LLM pairings, optimizes processes, and ensures continuous progress through performance evaluation.

## 2. Stakeholders
- **System Developers**: Require robust, maintainable code and clear documentation.
- **End Users**: Expect efficient task execution and reliable outcomes.
- **Administrators**: Need tools to monitor and adjust agent performance and system processes.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. **Agent Management**:
   - System must dynamically assign and manage agent-LLM pairings for tasks.
   - Support creation, deletion, and updating of agent profiles with unique IDs and roles.
2. **Task Management**:
   - System must allow task creation, assignment, and tracking with statuses (e.g., pending, completed).
   - Tasks must be assignable based on agent performance metrics.
3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - System must include judge agents to evaluate task performance.
   - Judges must provide structured output (JSON) with a score (0-1) and feedback.
   - Judge assignments must prioritize high-performing judges.
4. **Process Optimization**:
   - System must optimize agent-task assignments to maximize efficiency.
   - Must prevent endless loops of rework or over-optimization ("spinning the wheels").
5. **Interface**:
   - Must use OpenAI API for LLM interactions.
   - Must support structured JSON output for all LLM responses.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Programming Language**:
   - System must be implemented in Rust for performance and safety.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Must handle increasing numbers of agents, tasks, and evaluations without performance degradation.
3. **Reliability**:
   - System must ensure consistent progress and avoid infinite loops.
4. **Security**:
   - Must securely handle API keys and sensitive data.
5. **Maintainability**:
   - Code must be modular, well-documented, and adhere to Rust best practices.

## 5. Constraints
- Must integrate with OpenAI API for all LLM interactions.
- Structured output must be in JSON format.
- System must avoid external file I/O or network calls beyond OpenAI API.

## 6. Assumptions
- OpenAI API is available and reliable.
- Sufficient computational resources are available for Rust-based execution.
- Stakeholders have basic understanding of AI system management.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
- System successfully assigns agents to tasks and optimizes based on performance metrics.
- Judge agents produce structured JSON output with valid scores and feedback.
- System demonstrates progress without entering infinite loops in test scenarios.
- Code compiles and runs without errors in a Rust environment.
- API interactions are secure and efficient.
